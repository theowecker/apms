# APMS (Algorithms, Problems, Methods, Solutions)
A selection of toy problems in Python and other languages. The topics are varied and include:

* Physics and Mathematical methods
* Data structures
* Algorithms
* Machine learning
* Statistics
* and more...

Some of these are created in mind to review concepts and show solutions. 

Some are ideas that I have seen and wanted to work with from literature. 

I thought this would be a good place to make a large repo of a selection of algorithms.

This is a work in progress and will be updated as I go along.
